Case is compatible with PCB, FR4 plate and all hardware (standoffs and screws) from the original CBK kit (FR4 plate and hardware not provided in current QAZ sales).

2 Case files, one with handle holes, one without.

*All files are provided as is and I accept no liability if they aren't very good.*

*These files were made for 3D Print use and are not designed to be milled by a CNC machine. Milling will require changes to these files.*
